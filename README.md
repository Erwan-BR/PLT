## Introduction

This repository contains the code for a student project by four third-year engineering students:

- [Erwan BROUDIN · GitHub](https://github.com/Erwan-BR)

- [Maxime DELATOUCHE · GitHub](https://github.com/Hakamatsu)

- [Onur DEMIRBAS · GitHub](https://github.com/Xblaze37)

- [Adrien MILLASSEAU · GitHub](https://github.com/AMillasseau)

This repository is an adaptation of the *<u>It's a wonderful world</u>* board game, developed in C++.

## Brief explanation of the rules

In **It’s a Wonderful World**, you are leading an expanding **Empire**. You must choose
the path that will get you to develop faster and better than your competitors.
The game lasts **4 rounds**. Each round, you **draft** cards that you use to
produce Resources and develop your Empire.
After having chosen your **cards**, you can **recycle** some of them to acquire
Resources immediately, or slate them for **Construction** to produce **Resources** each
round and/or gain Victory Points. At the end of the 4 th round, the player with the
most Victory Points wins the game.

(For more information on the rules, please consult the [rules](https://github.com/Erwan-BR/PLT/tree/master/resources/rules) folder)

## Our goal

Our aim with this project is to create a fully functional game, from start to finish:

- Create all the classes that manage the game's elements
- Create the graphical interface to interact with the game.
- Create a network game for simultaneous multiplayer play.
- Carry out unit tests to ensure that our code works properly.
