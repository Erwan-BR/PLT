# Purpose of those files

To simplify the process of creating development cards, we have created an excel spreadsheet containing the various information.

If a modification must be made, you must :

1. Modify the xlsx file.
2. Export it to a csv file.
3. Delete the first three lines of the CSV file.

**Note**
A test of the file's correct operation should be carried out during make, to avoid launching a part that won't work.
